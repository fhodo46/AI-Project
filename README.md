# AI-Project
Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting human emotions expressed in textual data. 
The methodology employed in this sentiment analysis project involves the application of six distinct machine learning algorithms: 
Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. Each algorithm was chosen to explore various approaches to sentiment classification and to assess their effectiveness 
in capturing and understanding sentiment within the IMDb movie reviews dataset. For each algorithm, specific objectives were defined, including predicting probabilities, clustering similar texts, 
recommending sentiment labels based on similarity, classifying text into multiple sentiment classes, predicting likelihoods using probabilistic models, and developing nuanced sentiment analysis through deep learning.
The methods used for each algorithm vary, ranging from traditional machine learning approaches like Logistic Regression and SVM to unsupervised clustering 
with K-Means and personalized recommendations with KNN. 
Additionally, Naive Bayes was employed for probabilistic sentiment classification, and a neural network with LSTM or GRU layers, was utilized for sequence-based sentiment classification.
